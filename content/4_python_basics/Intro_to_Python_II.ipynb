    "### How to declare a new variable in Python \n",
    "In Python, you declare a new variable by typing a **variable name** and assigning a value to it. Here's a few examples of declaring variables:\n",

    "welcome = 'Hello World'\n",

    "* Do not use special characters in variable names other than _\n",

    "* Be descriptive with names. For example: `temperature_c` or `temp_c` is better than `t` \n",
    "* When in doubt, add a comment to remind yourself what the variable is: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # year of this course\n",
    "    y = 2025\n",

    "After declaring a variable, you can reassign the value associated with it by simply redeclaring it as the new desired value. In Python, the ability to reassign a variable's value is called *mutability*. Therefore, we say that variables are *mutable*. Here's an example:\n",

    "| `None` | Pronounced \"none\"; nothing - represents absence of a value | None |\n",

    "print(course + str(year))\n",

For example, if ```variable_1``` and ```variable_2``` are ```float``` then any arithmetic operator with these variables will return a ```float```.\n",

    "| `<` | Less than | variable_1 < variable_2 |\n",
    "| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | variable_1 >= variable_2 |\n",
    "| `<=` | Less than or equal to | variable_1 <= variable_2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike arithmetic operators, comparison operators will always return a ```bool```, which is either ```True``` or ```False```. For example if ```variable_1 = 1``` and ```variable_2 = 2```, then ```variable_1 < variable_2``` would return ```True```. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical operators\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine multiple comparison operators. \n",
    "| Operator | Description | Example |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| `and` | Returns ```True``` if both statements are true | variable_1>1 and variable_2<5 |\n",

    "\n",
    "But wow, that's a lot to type out! Not only is it tedious to type, more typing means more chances to make a mistake. Instead, let's simplify this code by using a ```for``` loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a For Loop using range()\n",
    "There are two main ways to structure a ```for``` loop in Python. Method 1 uses ```range()```  to loop through a set of code a specific number of times. This type of ```for``` loop is structured as follows: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(min, max)\n",
    "    # do these tasks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```range()``` returns a sequence of numbers. It starts from ```min```, and increments by 1 by default, and then ends at ```max-1```. Therefore, the regular language translation of this code is: For a sequence starting at ```min``` and ending at ```max``` with an increment of 1, do these tasks per increment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now implement this ```for``` loop structure into our countdown code above:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count_start = 10 # start the count down at 10\n",
    "for i in range(0,10) # sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",
    "    count_start = count_start - i # subtract the current increment number from count_start\n",
    "    print(count_start) # print the result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simplify ```range()``` more by what you input into it. ```range()``` has default settings that it will use if you do not specify your starting value and increment. The default starting value is 0, and the default increment is 1. Therefore, if we want a sequence of \"0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\", all we have to do is use ```range(10)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore simplify our countdown code further to the following: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "count_start = 10 # start the count down at 10\n",
    "for i in range(10) # interval length: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",
    "    count_start = count_start - i # subtract the current interval length from count_start\n",
    "    print(count_start) # print the result of the current interval\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our ```count_start``` variable is already assigned to the value 10, we can further simplify the code to the following: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "count_start = 10 # start the count down at 10\n",
    "for i in range(count_start) # interval length: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",
    "    count_start = count_start - i # subtract the current interval length from count_start\n",
    "    print(count_start) # print the result of the current interval\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code is now fully optimized! \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to specify an increment other than 1, we can add a third input into ```range()```. For example, ```range(0, 10, 2)``` starts at 0 and increments by 2 up to 10-1. Therefore, the sequence is: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. "

    "In many applications, one will write Python code that does many different tasks. The code can get quite long, which makes it harder to read through and catch mistakes, or repurpose for a different application later. To organize code by tasks in Python, we use *functions*. A *function* is a block of code that does a specific task. It is organized to have a *name*, *inputs (parameters)*, and *outputs (return values)*. \n",
