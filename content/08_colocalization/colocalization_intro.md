## Object-based colocalization 

Often when biological structures of interest are segmentable, they can be treated as objects.  
Objects are anything that can be meaningfully counted. For example:  

Points are objects that may, for instance, represent proteins of interest.  
Lines are objects that may, for instance, represent tissue boundaries.  
Areas are objects that may, for instance, represent nuclei or vesicles.  

In this notebook we analyse the spatial properties of points. This includes:  

- Mean distance to nearest neighbor  
- Nearest neighbor function  
- Ripley's K function  
- What is a null distribution  
- Using monte carlo simulations for statistical validation  

Although points are the simplest type of object, many of the learned concepts are generalizable to more complex types of objects.
